//! prod-codegen: renders `prod-ir` modules as Rust source text.
//!
//! This crate is `#![no_std]` (with `alloc`) and host-independent: it renders
//! Rust code as a plain `String`, never as `proc_macro2::TokenStream`, so it
//! can run on wasm32 or inside other hosts. `prod-macros` and `prod-cli` are
//! thin drivers on top of [`generate_module`].
//!
//! # Code generation policy
//!
//! The generated code targets the project's production standard: it must not
//! panic on caller-controlled input, and it must not allocate. Those two rules
//! drive everything below.
//!
//! ## Memory profile: no heap, ever
//!
//! Nothing rendered here can allocate. Lean `List α` is the only type that
//! would naïvely need a heap, so its lowering is position-dependent:
//!
//! - **Parameter position** → `&[α]`. `List.nil` match arms render as the
//!   slice pattern `[]` and `List.cons (h t)` as `[h, t @ ..]`, so structural
//!   recursion passes the tail sub-slice directly — no rebinding, no copying.
//! - **Return position** → a caller-owned output buffer. The signature gains a
//!   trailing `output: &mut [α]` and returns `Result<usize, ComputeError>`,
//!   the length of the initialized prefix. The body is rendered in *builder
//!   mode*: `List.nil` becomes `Ok(0)`; `List.cons h t` splits one element off
//!   the front of the buffer (`split_first_mut`, so exhaustion is an `Err`,
//!   never an index panic), writes the head, recurses the tail into the
//!   remainder, and returns `1 +` the tail's length. `if`/`let`/`cases`
//!   recurse into builder mode; `let`-bound list values (LCNF emits lists in
//!   A-normal form) are resolved through a scoped environment rather than
//!   materialized.
//! - **Zero-argument definitions returning a list** (the golden values) →
//!   `&'static [α]` built from a promoted array literal.
//!
//! A list value that reaches any other position — an intermediate value used
//! as something other than a builder tail, or a list nested inside another
//! type — is an [`Error::UnsupportedList`]: an honest codegen failure rather
//! than a silently allocating fallback. `Type::Vec` is rejected outright as
//! [`Error::HeapType`].
//!
//! ## Error contract: fallibility is precise, not uniform
//!
//! Lean `Nat` maps to bounded `u64`, fixed-width Lean `Int64` maps to `i64`,
//! and mathematical Lean `Int` is rejected as [`Error::UnboundedInt`] rather
//! than silently narrowed. The partial operations report failure instead of panicking: addition, multiplication,
//! shifts, and powers render as `checked_*(..).ok_or(crate::ComputeError::X)?`
//! (with the shift/power exponent narrowed through
//! `u32::try_from(..).map_err(..)?`). Subtraction saturates at zero (Lean Nat
//! subtraction) and division/modulo by zero return zero (Lean Nat's total
//! operations), so neither is fallible. There is no bignum fallback, so this
//! is exact only while values fit in `u64`.
//!
//! A definition returns `Result<T, crate::ComputeError>` **only if it needs
//! to**: if its body contains a checked operation, or calls a definition that
//! is itself fallible, or builds a list into a caller buffer. That is a least
//! fixpoint over the module's call graph ([`Shape`]), so leaf definitions and
//! the zero-argument goldens keep their plain return types. Calls to fallible
//! definitions render as `f(args)?`.
//!
//! ## Other lowerings
//!
//! - **LCNF nodes**:
//!   - `Match` renders as a Rust `match`, with `default` becoming the `_` arm.
//!     The Nat structural-recursion ctors are special-cased: `Nat.zero` renders
//!     as the literal pattern `0`, and `Nat.succ k` as the `_` arm with
//!     `k` bound to `(scrut).saturating_sub(1)` (exact, since the zero arm
//!     matches first). `Bool.true`/`Bool.false` → `true`/`false` patterns, and
//!     `Option.none`/`Option.some v` → `None`/`Some(v)` patterns. The List
//!     ctors use the slice patterns described above.
//!   - `Ctor` renders as tuple-style construction `Name(args...)` (bare `Name`
//!     when there are no args), except `Prod.mk`, which renders as a Rust
//!     tuple `(a, b)` — nested for right-nested pairs — and the Bool/Option
//!     ctors, which render as `true`/`false` and `None`/`Some(x)`.
//!   - `Proj` renders straight through: `(proj "Type" "field" e)` becomes
//!     `e.field` (raw-escaped if `field` is a Rust keyword). The field name
//!     is resolved once, in `Lower.lean`, against Lean's own structure info
//!     — codegen holds no type-keyed lookup table, so there is no second
//!     copy of the declaration that could disagree with the first and swap
//!     fields silently. `crate::Instance` is generated like any other type
//!     and mirrors the Lean structure's own field spelling (`q`, `T`, `O`)
//!     for exactly this reason.
//!
//!   - `Type::Tuple` renders as a Rust tuple type, so
//!     `(Tuple Nat (Tuple Nat Nat))` becomes `(u64, (u64, u64))`.
//!   - `Unreachable` renders as `unreachable!()`.
//!   - **Jp/Jmp policy**: a join point with exactly one `jmp` caller that is
//!     not inside its own body is inlined at the jump site as
//!     `{ let p = arg; ...; <jp body> }`, and the declaration site renders as
//!     `()`. A join point with no callers renders its body in place. Anything
//!     else — cyclic, or several callers — is rejected as
//!     [`Error::UnsupportedJoinPoint`], because it would need real control
//!     flow. This used to emit a `loop {}` skeleton with a "manual port
//!     required" comment, which did not compile: the join point's parameters
//!     were never bound, and each jump site had type `()` where its arm
//!     needed a value.
//!
//! ## Recursion
//!
//! Generated recursion is structurally bounded by a fuel or data argument (the
//! Lean side must already be terminating for LCNF to emit it), so stack depth
//! is a function of the caller's inputs, not of unbounded search.
